Currently:

The site is live, but it is deriving it's data from localhost. The JSON file needs to be moved to TwoPines, and then the code needs to be altered in /API.

There's a chance that because the root of the project on Vercel is /client, that there may be a whole problem with how the data is being retrieved, and the JSON may have to move to /client instead.
